"""``research.*`` JSON-RPC methods: typed append to ``research_campaign.jsonl``.

The :func:`create_campaign` method is the daemon-canonical writer for
``<state_dir>/store/research_campaign.jsonl``. The ``eawf research campaign
new`` CLI surface proxies a staged campaign through this RPC so the
single-writer invariant in AGENTS rule 4 holds; it falls back to the shared
:func:`persist_campaign` helper directly only when the daemon is unavailable
(CI / one-shot / a daemon predating this method).

The append is **non-state**: no
:class:`~eawf.kernel.state.mutations.MutationKind` is allocated and the
daemon's WAL recovery path treats campaign rows as derivable replay no-ops,
same as event / audit / evidence appends. Downstream consumers (the Research
board topic tree) re-validate the row by reading the envelope back and running
``ResearchCampaignPayload.model_validate(envelope.payload)``.
